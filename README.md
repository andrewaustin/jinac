This is a addon to node.js which exposes compiled C++ code to javascript programs through the V8 interpreter.
Eventually, the goal is to provide objects representing mathematical expressions, and ways of manipulating them using computer algebra.

This project was started in response to the growing need for high-performance grading of mathematics in web-based educational software.

ONLY WORKS ON DEBIAN LINUX!

Dependencies:
